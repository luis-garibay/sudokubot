//	;	First operation: Record possibilities
//	For each unknown cell
//		For each number 1-9
//			If the number doesn't exist in the cell's row AND the number doesn't exist in the cell's column AND the number doesn't exist in the cell's 3x3 group
//				Mark number down as possibility in the cell
//		Done
//	Done
//	;	Second operation: Remove possibilities
//	For each unknown cell
//		If there are cells in the cell's row that are in other 3x3 groups AND that row in the 3x3 group is the only one with that number as a possibility
//			Remove the number as a possibility in the cell
//	Done
//	;	Third operation: Record the logical answers, such as the lone possible answers and the only cells in each group, row, and column where a number is possible
