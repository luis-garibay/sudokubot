# sudokubot
A repository to track progress on my sudokubot project.

# Purpose
My goal for the sudokubot project is to write a program to solve sudoku puzzles as efficiently as I can make it do so.
I want it to run "efficiently", with respect to both memory and speed.

The purpose of this repository is to track my work on the project.

# Use
I'd like the sudokubot project to have a fairly simple command-line interface.
When finished, the usage should look something like this: "usage: sudokubot <input sudoku file> <ouput solution file>"
